# Objective‑C is...

- A strict superset of C (along the same lines as C++, but actually 
  [moreso](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19366134/what-does-objective-c-is-a-superset-of-c-more-strictly-than-c-mean-exactly):
  every valid C program is a valid Objective‑C program).
- Statically typed.
  - But lacking generics, algebraic data types, and other features of "modern" 
    type systems.
- A fancy runtime.
  - Allows for metaprogramming: asking an object what messages it responds to 
    at runtime, forwarding messages to other objects on the fly, etc.
  - Normally we don't do this sort of thing, but some of Apple's libraries use 
    it to great effect, and it can be very handy for unit tests, debugging, etc.
- Pretty portable despite only being commonly used in the Appleverse.
  - Can be compiled by LLVM and GCC on most operating systems.
  - The runtime is [open 
    source](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/objc4-437.1/runtime/objc-runtime.m).
- A language that uses *[message 
  passing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing)* instead of direct 
  method dispatch.
  - So, more like Smalltalk than Java and more like Ruby than JavaScript.
- Verbose and cryptic (until you get the hang of it):
    ```objc
    NSString *newString = [oldString stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@"foo"
                                                               withString:@"bar"
                                                                  options:NSCaseInsensitiveSearch
                                                                    range:NSMakeRange(0, 10)];
    ```

# Some things that make Objective‑C special

## (and/or "special")


---


## [Initializers](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Initialization/Initialization.html) (are basically constructors)

The first message you pass to a class to get an object is `alloc`.

```objc
[SomeClass alloc];
```

But at this point it's pretty useless; you need to initialize it:

```objc
[[SomeClass alloc] init];
```

Now the object is ready to use. It has its instance variables set to default 
values and has configured any shared resources it may need (caches, filesystem 
handles, etc).


---


## More complicated initializers

Initializers may take arguments:

```objc
[[UIColor alloc] initWithRed:0.5 green:0.1 blue:0.3 alpha:0];
```

And objects may have multiple initializers which accept different sets of 
arguments.

#### Rules of thumb for initializer implementation

- Always invoke the superclass (super) initializer first.
- Return `nil` to the receiver if anything goes wrong.
- If an object has multiple initializers, the one with the most flexibility 
  should be the *designated initializer* and other initializers should be 
  shortcuts for it.

```objc
- (id)initWithTitle:(NSString *)title date:(NSDate *)date {
    if (self = [super init]) {
        self.title = title;
        self.date = date;
    }
    return self;
}

- (id)initWithTitle:(NSString *)title {
    return [self initWithTitle:title date:[NSDate date]];
}

- (id)init {
    return [self initWithTitle:@"Task"];
}
```


---


## Memory "management" (ARC)

ARC stands for *[automatic reference 
counting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Reference_Counting)*. When 
enabled at compile time it supports a (limited) form of garbage collection.

All objects have a *retain count* to track how many other objects are 
interested in it. Once the retain count reaches 0 it should be safe to 
deallocate the object.

Without ARC, programmers send explicit `retain` and `release` messages to 
objects to manage retain counts. ARC inserts these for you, but it does **not** 
handle cyclical references and other nontrivial scenarios.


---


## Blocks

[Blocks](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithBlocks/WorkingwithBlocks.html) 
are anonymous functions.

As in other languages that support functions-as-objects, they're often used for 
callbacks and other asynchronous behavior.

Blocks are 
[closures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_programming%29), 
but external variables are captured by value (and are read-only) unless 
specified otherwise.

The [syntax for blocks](http://fuckingblocksyntax.com/) is arcane and differs 
depending on the context in which you're defining a block. Blocks are 
strongly-typed (their type is defined by argument types and the return type).

#### Example

```objc
HungryPerson *bob = [[HungryPerson alloc] initWithName:@"Bob"];

[tacoService orderTacos:3 completionHandler:^(NSArray *tacos, NSError *error) {
    if (!error) {
        [bob eatFood:tacos];
    }
}];
```

Order some tacos for Bob and tell him to eat them when they're ready (unless 
something went wrong).


---


## Pointers vs. primitives

Like other C-ish languages, Objective‑C has primitive values and pointers. 
Unlike Java and some other OO languages, there is no concept of auto-boxing. 
However, there is `@(...)` syntactical sugar for explicit boxing:

```objc
int meaningOfLife = 42;
NSNumber *trueMeaningOfLife = @(meaningOfLife);
```

Somewhat confusingly, `NSNumber` is the box for all types of numbers, 
booleans, and characters. All of these produce `NSNumber`s:
```objc
@(12);
@(-0.5);
@(YES); // Note that YES == true; they're mostly interchangeable but YES/NO is idiomatic Objective‑C.
@('X');
```

Boxing is useful in many cases, particularly if you want to store primitive 
values in a collection (Objective‑C's collections can only contain pointers):

```objc
NSArray *stuff = @[
  @"foo",
  @3.14,
  @YES,
  100, // This will not compile! It needs to be a pointer.
];
```


---


## Message passing

You don't "call a method" on an object, you "pass a message" to it. In many 
cases this is a distinction without a difference.

Messages are values of the type `SEL`. You can create a `SEL` with the 
`@selector(...)` compiler directive. For example:

```objc
Person *personA = [[Person alloc] init];
Person *personB = [[Person alloc] init];

SEL action;
if (personA.nice) {
    action = @selector(giveACookieTo:);
} else if (personA.mean) {
    action = @selector(punchFaceOf:);
} else {
    action = @selector(ignore:);
}

[personA performSelector:action withObject:personB]; // e.g. [personA giveACookieTo:personB]
```

The compiler will help you out and issue warnings if you use `@selector(...)` 
to reference a selector that it can't find in any public interfaces, but note 
that it does not know ahead of time which object will receive this selector, 
so some errors might not be caught until runtime.


---


## Other things to keep in mind

- Objective‑C does not have namespaces (that's why you see ugly prefixes on 
  class names and global variables).
  - The reserved `NS` prefix stands for 
    "[NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP)", where most of the 
    early development of the standard library ("Foundation") happened.

- `nil` eats all messages and always returns `nil`.
  ```objc
  id someVariable = nil;
  [someVariable thisMethodDoesNotExist:true] == nil;
  ```
  This avoids null pointer exceptions, but it means you should explicitly check 
  for `nil`s in some places.

- ["`@`" means "this is a thing that the Objective‑C compiler will 
  preprocess"](http://nshipster.com/at-compiler-directives/). For example:
  ```objc
  @"hello";
  // is syntax sugar for
  [NSString stringWithUTF8String:"hello"];
  ```
  ```objc
  @selector(someMessage:withArgument:);
  // is syntax sugar for
  sel_registerName("someMessage:withArgument:");
  ```
